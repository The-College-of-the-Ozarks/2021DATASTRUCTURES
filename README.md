# 2021DATASTRUCTURES
Reources for the FA 2021 CSC Data Structures Class


Structure for homework submissions is as follows:


|the root folder of the project repository


|----weekX


|----|----student1


|----|----studentN


"studentN" being the lowercase name of the student (NO MIDDLE INITIALS/NAMES): i.e. '/week4/johnsmith'. Within each student folder we will want to separate their assignments into folders ordered numerically. 

Ex: /weekN/

          firstlast/
          
                    assignment1/
                    
                    assignment2/
                    
                    assignmentN/
                    
                    
                    
Will update once convention on project file names are established.
